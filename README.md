## Introduction

This repository provides an implementation of gradient-based watershed video segmentation. The segmentation algorithm utilizes the watershed algorithm applied to gradients computed from video frames.

## Motivation

Video segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, enabling various applications such as object tracking, scene understanding, and activity recognition. This project aims to provide a simple yet effective method for segmenting videos based on gradient information.

## Features

- Applies gradient-based watershed algorithm for video segmentation.
- Enables visualization of original video frames alongside segmented video frames.
- Allows customization of segmentation parameters for different video datasets.
